# MeshCore Repeater Collisions

MeshCore effectively uses the **first 2 hex characters of your public key** as a short “node ID” prefix.  
If two nodes in the same mesh share that prefix (example: `a3`), tools that rely on the short ID can get confused.

This guide shows how to change your keypair so your repeater gets a **different 2-digit prefix**, using a **serial (USB) connection** and the MeshCore CLI command:

```
set prv.key <PRIVATE_KEY_HERE>
```

---

## Symptoms of a prefix collision

- You see ambiguous node IDs (same 2-digit prefix) in neighbor lists / path info
- Debugging range/links becomes annoying because two nodes “look” the same at a glance

## What you’ll need

* A PC connected to the repeater via **USB serial**
* The **MeshCore web console**

  * [https://flasher.meshcore.co.uk/](https://flasher.meshcore.co.uk/)
* A new keypair with a **non-colliding prefix**, generated via:

  * The web keygen: [https://gessaman.com/mc-keygen/](https://gessaman.com/mc-keygen/)


## Step 1: Check what prefixes are already in use nearby

You can check prefixes a couple different ways:

### Option A: MeshCore Analyzer
Browse the repeater list for the region `CLE` and look at the prefixes already in use:  
https://analyzer.letsmesh.net/nodes/repeaters

### Option B: Discord bot
In the Discord server, run the command `/prefix-list` in `#meshcore-general` channel, and check the prefixes shown there.

> Goal: pick a prefix that isn’t already common around your local mesh.

## Step 2: Generate a new keypair with your chosen prefix

You can generate a keypair via the web keygen.

###  Web keygen

Go to:
[https://gessaman.com/mc-keygen/](https://gessaman.com/mc-keygen/)

1. Enter/select your **target prefix** (2 hex characters)
2. Generate a keypair
3. Copy the **private key**

MeshCore expects the private key as **128 hex characters** (one continuous string).

---

## Step 3: Set the new private key over serial

Go to:
https://flasher.meshcore.co.uk/

1. Click on `Console`
2. Select the device in the popup window.
3. Enter the command below to change the key.

```txt
set prv.key <PRIVATE_KEY_HERE>
```

### Paste safety checklist

* The key is **exactly 128 hex characters**
* No spaces, no line breaks, no quotes
* Make sure you didn’t accidentally copy extra characters before/after the key

---

## Step 4: Reboot the repeater

```txt
reboot
```

---

## Step 5: Verify

After reboot:

1. Check the repeater’s public key (web UI/app/console)
2. Confirm the **first 2 hex characters** match the prefix you chose
3. Send a few adverts so the network sees the new identity

---

## Important gotchas

Changing the private key changes the node’s identity.

After re-keying, you may need to update:

* ACLs / allowlists that reference the old pubkey
* Dashboards, automations, or monitoring that key off the old identity
* Anything else that “remembers” your node by pubkey

---

### Rebuild kit (highly recommended)

A solid extra step is to save a small “rebuild kit” for each repeater (in a password manager or somewhere safe):

- **Private key** (the 128-hex string)
- **Repeater name**
- **Admin password**
- **Lat/long** (if you publish location)

If you ever need to reflash or replace a board, you can restore these values and bring it back up **identical to what’s in the field**, without guessing or reconfiguring from scratch.

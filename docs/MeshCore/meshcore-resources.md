# MeshCore Resources

Here are the main links we reference most often across **NEO Mesh** for MeshCore.

## MeshCore Resources

The official MeshCore site and documentation are the best places to start for core guides and project updates.

* **MeshCore:** https://meshcore.io/
* **GitHub Docs:** https://docs.meshcore.io/
* **Repeater & Room Server CLI Reference:** https://github.com/meshcore-dev/MeshCore/wiki/Repeater-&-Room-Server-CLI-Reference

Start there for installation steps, configuration details, and CLI usage before exploring community tools or custom builds.

## Firmware

This is where you’ll find the **officialMeshCore firmware** and the easiest way to flash it onto supported hardware. It’s typically the fastest path from “new board” to “on the air.”

### Easy SkyMesh Custom Firmware

In the NEO region, many of us are running IoTThinks’ custom MeshCore firmware (Easy SkyMesh), which helps improve power savings on repeaters.

- IoTThinks Repo: https://github.com/IoTThinks/EasySkyMesh

### WiFi Companion Firmware

This firmware is used to make your node connect to WiFi.

When flashing, you enter the WiFi SSID and password directly on the flasher page. The credentials are embedded during the flash process so the device can join your network on first boot.

## LetsMesh Analyzer

A real-time packet and reliability analysis tool for the MeshCore network. It helps repeater owners monitor health, spot abuse/bugs, and improve overall reliability using data collected from MQTT-connected observer nodes.

## Live Map (NEO Mesh)

Our live map is the quickest way to see active nodes, recent activity, and overall mesh health in near real time. Powered by [CoreScope](https://github.com/Kpa-clawbot/CoreScope), an open-source MeshCore analyzer by [Kpa-clawbot](https://github.com/Kpa-clawbot).
